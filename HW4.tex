\question[4.29] Show that if $G$ is a finite group with identity $e$ and with an even number of elements, then there exists an element $a \neq e$ in $G$ such that $a * a = e$.
\begin{solution}
\textbf{General Idea:}
The group $G$ has an even number of elements. Removing the identity element $e$ leaves an odd number of non-identity elements. We define the relationship of an element "pairing" with its inverse. If no element is its own inverse (other than $e$), then the non-identity elements would group perfectly into pairs of size 2. This would imply the number of non-identity elements is even, leading to a contradiction.

    Let $G$ be a group with even order $|G| = 2n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
    Consider the set of non-identity elements $G \setminus \{e\}$.
    The cardinality of this set is:
    \[ |G \setminus \{e\}| = |G| - 1 = 2n - 1. \]
    Since $2n - 1$ is an odd number, $G \setminus \{e\}$ contains an odd number of elements.

    We prove by contradiction. Assume for contradiction that there is no element $a \in G \setminus \{e\}$ such that $a * a = e$.
    This assumption implies that for all $x \in G \setminus \{e\}$, $x \neq x^{-1}$.

    By Theorem 4.17, every element $x$ has exactly one inverse $x^{-1}$. Since $x \neq e$, we know $x^{-1} \neq e$, so $x^{-1} \in G \setminus \{e\}$.
    Because we assumed $x \neq x^{-1}$, we can pair every element $x$ in $G \setminus \{e\}$ with its unique and distinct inverse $x^{-1}$ to a subset $\{x, x^{-1}\}$ of size 2.
    
    These pairs are disjoint. Thus, $G \setminus \{e\}$ is the union of $k$ distinct pairs for some natural number $k$
    \[ G \setminus \{e\} = \{x_1, x_1^{-1}\} \cup \{x_2, x_2^{-1}\} \cup \dots \cup \{x_k, x_k^{-1}\} \]
    This implies that the total number of elements in $G \setminus \{e\}$ is $|G \setminus \{e\}| = 2k$, which is an even number.

    This contradicts our earlier observation that $|G \setminus \{e\}| = 2n - 1$ is an odd number.
    Therefore, our assumption is false. There must exist at least one element $a \in G \setminus \{e\}$ (so $a \neq e$) such that $a = a^{-1}$.
    
    Multiplying($*$) by $a$ on the right, we obtain
    \[ a * a = e. \]
\end{solution}



\question[4.37] Let $G$ be a group and suppose that $a * b * c = e$ for $a, b, c \in G$. Show that $b * c * a = e$ also.
\begin{solution}
\textbf{General Idea:}
We are given that the product $a * b * c$ is the identity. This implies that the inverse of this product, $(a * b * c)^{-1}$, must also be the identity $e$. We use Corollary 4.18 to expand this inverse as $c^{-1} * b^{-1} * a^{-1}$. By manipulating this expanded form, we can show the desired result.


    We are given $a * b * c = e$.
    Taking the inverse of both sides, we have:
    \[ (a * b * c)^{-1} = e^{-1} = e \]
    
    By Corollary 4.18, the inverse of a product is the product of the inverses in reverse order. Thus:
    \[ (a * b * c)^{-1} = c^{-1} * (a*b)^{-1}=c^{-1} * b^{-1} * a^{-1} \]
    together, we have
    \begin{equation}
        c^{-1} * b^{-1} * a^{-1} = e \label{eq:inverse_identity}
    \end{equation}

    Now, consider the expression we wish to evaluate: $b * c * a$.
    We can multiply the equation (\ref{eq:inverse_identity}) by $b * c$ on the left:
    \begin{align*}
        (b * c) * (c^{-1} * b^{-1} * a^{-1}) &= (b * c) * e \\
        b * (c * c^{-1}) * b^{-1} * a^{-1} &= b * c \quad (\text{By Associativity}) \\
        b * e * b^{-1} * a^{-1} &= b * c \quad (\text{Inverse   } c * c^{-1} = e) \\
        b * b^{-1} * a^{-1} &= b * c \quad (\text{Identity  }) \\
        e * a^{-1} &= b * c \quad (\text{Inverse  }) \\
        a^{-1} &= b * c
    \end{align*}
    
    Finally, we substitute this result ($b * c = a^{-1}$) back into our target expression $b * c * a$:
    \begin{align*}
        b * c * a &= (a^{-1}) * a \\
        &= e \quad (\text{Inverse  })
    \end{align*}
    
    Thus, $b * c * a = e$.
\end{solution}



\question[5.8] Determine whether the given set of invertible $n \times n$ matrices with real number entries is a subgroup of $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$: The $n \times n$ matrices with determinant $2$.
\begin{solution}
\textbf{General Idea:}
To determine if a subset is a subgroup, we check the criteria from Theorem 5.14 that closure under the operation, identity, and inverses.
In this case, we suspect the set is not a subgroup. We can prove it by showing it fails the closure property. Since the determinant of a product is the product of determinants ($\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)$) by MAT215, multiplying two matrices with determinant 2 will result in a matrix with determinant 4, which falls outside our set.


    Let $H$ be the set of $n \times n$ matrices with determinant 2:
    \[ H = \{ A \in GL(n, \mathbb{R}) \mid \det(A) = 2 \}. \]
    We claim that $H$ is not a subgroup of $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$.

    \begin{proof}
    We show that $H$ fails the closure requirement of Theorem 5.14 (1).
    Let $A$ and $B$ be arbitrary elements of $H$. By definition, $\det(A) = 2$ and $\det(B) = 2$.
    
    Recall from MAT215 the property of determinants for matrix multiplication:
    \[ \det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B). \]
    Substituting the values for $A$ and $B$:
    \[ \det(AB) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4. \]
    
    For $AB$ to be in $H$, we would require $\det(AB) = 2$. Since $4 \neq 2$, we have $AB \notin H$.
    
    Therefore, $H$ is not closed under matrix multiplication. By Theorem 5.14, $H$ is not a subgroup of $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$.
    \end{proof}
\end{solution}

In Exercises 41 and 42, let $\phi : G \to G'$ be an isomorphism of a group
$(G, *)$ with a group $(G', *')$. Write out a proof to convince a skeptic
of the intuitively clear statement.



\question[5.41]  If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then
\[
\phi[H] = \{\phi(h) \mid h \in H\}
\]
is a subgroup of $G'$. That is, an isomorphism carries subgroups into subgroups.
\begin{solution} 
\textbf{General idea}
To prove that a subset is a subgroup, we apply the Theorem 5.14. We must verify three things for the set $\phi[H]$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identity\textbf{:} The identity of $G'$ must be in $\phi[H]$.
    \item Closure\textbf{:} If we take two elements $x, y$ from $\phi[H]$, their product $x *' y$ must also be in $\phi[H]$.
    \item Inverses\textbf{:} If $x$ is in $\phi[H]$, its inverse $x^{-1}$ must be in $\phi[H]$.
\end{enumerate}


Since $\phi$ is an injective on the entire domain $G$. Restricting the domain to a subset $H$ cannot break injectivity. Thus, $\phi_H$ is injective. By definition, $\phi$ maps $H$ onto its image $\phi[H]$, so it is surjective onto $\phi[H]$. Therefore, $\phi$ induces a bijection between $H$ and $\phi[H]$.


    Let $H \le G$. We claim that $\phi[H]$ is a subgroup of $G'$ by verifying the conditions of Theorem 5.14.

    \begin{proof}
    \textbf{1. Identity:}
    Since $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, the identity element $e$ of $G$ is in $H$.
    By the homomorphism property of $\phi$. $\phi(e) = e'$, where $e'$ is the identity of $G'$.
    Since $e \in H$, we have $\phi(e) \in \phi[H]$. Thus, $e' \in \phi[H]$.

    \textbf{2. Closure:}
    Let $x, y \in \phi[H]$ be arbitrary.
    By the definition of the image set $\phi[H]$, there exist $h_1, h_2 \in H$ such that $\phi(h_1) = x$ and $\phi(h_2) = y$.
    Consider the product $x *' y$:
    \begin{align*}
        x *' y &= \phi(h_1) *' \phi(h_2) \\
        &= \phi(h_1 * h_2) \quad (\text{Since } \phi \text{ is a homomorphism})
    \end{align*}
    Since $H$ is a subgroup, it is closed under the operation of $G$. Thus, $h_1 * h_2 \in H$.
    Consequently, $\phi(h_1 * h_2) \in \phi[H]$, so $x *' y \in \phi[H]$.

    \textbf{3. Inverses:}
    Let $x \in \phi[H]$. Then $x = \phi(h)$ for some $h \in H$.
    Since $H$ is a subgroup, $h^{-1} \in H$.
    Consider the inverse $x^{-1}$:
    \begin{align*}
        x^{-1} &= (\phi(h))^{-1} \\
        &= \phi(h^{-1}) \quad (\text{By Theorem 13.12b})
    \end{align*}
    Since $h^{-1} \in H$, it follows that $\phi(h^{-1}) \in \phi[H]$. Thus $x^{-1} \in \phi[H]$.

    Since $\phi[H]$ satisfies all conditions of Theorem 5.14, it is a subgroup of $G'$.
    \end{proof}
